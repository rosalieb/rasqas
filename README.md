Functions to read, assemble, and standardize high-frequency data collected by autonomous environmental sensors. The package currently provides functions to ingest heterogeneous text and CSV files produced by multiple sensor manufacturers, automatically detect date-time formats, clean and harmonize measurements, and assess sensor drift compared to a reference sensor. 

_rasqas_ is still at the embryonal stage... Future developments will extend the package with additional methods for data qualification, analysis, and visualization of sensor time series.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rasqas like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(rosalieb/rasqas)
```

## Example

Coming soon...
