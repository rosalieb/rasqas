# rasqas: Read, Assemble, Standardize, Qualify and Analyze data from autonomous Sensors

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Functions to read, assemble, and standardize high-frequency data collected by autonomous environmental sensors. The package currently provides functions to ingest heterogeneous text and CSV files produced by multiple sensor manufacturers, automatically detect date-time formats, clean and harmonize measurements, and assess sensor drift compared to a reference sensor. Future developments will extend the package with additional methods for data qualification, analysis, and visualization of sensor time series.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rasqas like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(rosalieb/rasqas)
```
