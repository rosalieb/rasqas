Description: Functions to read, assemble, and standardize high-frequency data
    collected by autonomous environmental sensors. The package currently
    provides functions to ingest heterogeneous text and CSV files produced
    by multiple sensor manufacturers, automatically detect date-time formats,
    clean and harmonize measurements, and assess sensor drift compared to a 
    reference sensor. Future developments will extend the package with 
    additional methods for data qualification, analysis, and visualization of 
    sensor time series.
