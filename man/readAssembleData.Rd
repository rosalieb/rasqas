\title{Read and assemble high-frequency sensor data from a folder}
\usage{
readAssembleData(
  folderpath,
  patterns2searchfor = NULL,
  patterns2exclude = c("00_drift_results", "@",
    "pres_air|pres_eau|pres.txt|pres_cote|pression|Pres.csv", "aff.txt", "status.txt",
    "lire.txt", "Sorties.txt", "aff_quinson", "allos CR.txt", "00_ALIRE.txt"),
  language = "fr"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folderpath}{Character vector of one or more paths to folders containing
sensor data files (.txt or .csv).}

\item{patterns2searchfor}{Optional character vector of patterns to include when
selecting files to read (e.g. station or site codes).}

\item{patterns2exclude}{Character vector of patterns used to exclude files
when selecting files to read.}

\item{language}{Language used for progress and informational messages
printed to the console. Default is French ("fr"); English ("en") is also supported.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{data_list}: a list of data frames, one per successfully read file,
containing standardized sensor data
\item \code{skipped_files}: names of files that were skipped during processing
\item \code{read_files}: names of files that were successfully read
\item \code{log_progress}: a data frame summarizing metadata for each file
(sensor type, manufacturer, serial number, date range, and available variables)
}
}
\description{
Reads high-frequency data from multiple sensor files contained in one or more
folders, automatically detecting file formats, column separators, headers,
and date-time formats. The function cleans and standardizes the data, converts
date-times to UTC, and extracts key variables such as temperature, pressure,
and dissolved oxygen when available.
}
\details{
Multiple sensor types and manufacturers (e.g. HOBO, MiniDOT, Tinytag) are
supported through flexible parsing and heuristic-based detection.

This function relies on heuristic rules to identify file structure, sensor
metadata, and date-time formats. While it is designed to handle a wide range
of common sensor exports, unusual file formats may require code adaptation.
